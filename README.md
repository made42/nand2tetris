# From Nand to Tetris
### Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

My implementation of the projects from the Nand to Tetris courses.

#### About the Software

The Nand2tetris Software Suite consists of two directories: *projects*, and *tools*. 

The projects directory is divided into 14 project directories named 00, 01, ..., 13 (of which project 00 is relevant only to learners who take the course in Coursera, and project 13 is open-ended). These directories contain files that you have to modify and complete as you work on various nand2tetris projects. 

The tools directory contains the nand2tetris software tools. It's a collection of programs and files that will be explained as you follow the various projects.
